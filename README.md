# workshop-troubleshooting-rsc2019
A place for instructors and TAs to log issues during rstudio::conf 2019 workshops

This repo will be used to develop a “best practices” for running a workshop, which we'll use internally for future rstudio::conf workshops and which we'll share with the community to help address recurring pain points related to workshop logistics (workspace setup, installation problems, etc.).
